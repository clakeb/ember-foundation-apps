# Foundation Apps for Ember

This project is a port of the [Foundation Apps](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps) for Angular.

This project will be built as an [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) addon by using the [ES6 module syntax](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules#quick_examples).

Until we have a beta release, follow progress in open [milestones](https://github.com/tatemz/ember-foundation-apps/milestones) or the [develop branch](https://github.com/tatemz/ember-foundation-apps/tree/develop).
